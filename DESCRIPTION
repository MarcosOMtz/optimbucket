Title: Optimal Bucketing Based on ROC Curves
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Felipe Gerard
Maintainer: Felipe Gerard <felipegerard@gmail.com>
Description: This package helps bucket continuous and ordinal variables in a
    way that maximizes AUC. It also has convenient interfaces for manual bucketing,
    manipulation and plotting of ROC curves and handling of special values. The
    original idea came from Ramón Jiménez, who came up with the "Optimal Gini
    Algorithm" and a subsequent way of pasting buckets for variables in Credit
    Scoring models.
