# optimbucket

This is an R package designed to help you bucket variables in a fast and optimal way. It uses Gini as a criterion but has several helper functions to do things manually.

Among other things, you can manipulate, plot and print ROC curves and different bucketings in a variety of ways. There are also functions for doing this process for a complete dataset automatically.
